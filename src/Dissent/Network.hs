-- | Network utility functions for Dissent
--
--   Since we are using quite a different aproach than regular networking, we
--   provide a few utility functions here. Specifically, we will run a server
--   that accepts only a single connection and then closes. Furthermore, we
--   provide a function that attempts to connect to a remote host, possibly
--   indefinitely, and blocks until a connection has been established.
