-- | RSA crypto utility functions
--
--   High-level wrapper around the somewhat arcane HsOpenssl library. There are
--   various alternative libraries around, but I don't trust them. I would really
--   like to use libsodium / saltine, but the author specifically advices against
--   using it, so I will follow that advice.
--
--   Furthermore, there are various other pure-haskell RSA/AES libraries around,
--   but I don't think they have undergone the same scrutiny and peer reviews as
--   OpenSSL has. So for now, we will wrap OpenSSL in a nice interface, and mark
--   this as a to-do for the future. We will hard-code our preferences in this
--   module.
--
--   The implementation of this module, and usage of the HsOpenSSL API, will need
--   proper peer review.
